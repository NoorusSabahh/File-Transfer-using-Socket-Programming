# File-Transfer-using-Socket-Programming
This project aims to implement a socket programming solution that allows for the transfer of files between two hosts.

The solution can handle large files and also implement error checking and handling to ensure that files are
transferred correctly It can also handle the case when the server is offline or cannot be reached.


## Usage

1. Start the server by running python server.py on one host.
2. Start the client by running python client.py on the other host.
3. Follow the prompts on the client to specify the file to be transferred and the destination path.
4. The file will be transferred from the client to the server.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
